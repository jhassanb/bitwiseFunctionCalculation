# bitwiseFunctionCalculation
This project included solving eight coding puzzles using bitwise functions and a heavy set of restrictions regarding what bitwise operators can be used and the maximum number of bitwise operators allowed. 
Puzzles included:
Bitwise AND (&) using only the operators NOT (~) and OR (|)
Bitwise IMPLY gate using only the operators NOT (~) and OR (|)
Returning an integer with every fourth bit set to 1 using only the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
Extracting bit n from word x using only the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
ReplaceByte(x,n,c) - Replace byte n in x with c using the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
Returning 0 if x == y, and 1 otherwise using the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
isCapitalizedLetter - return 1 if 0x41 <= x <= 0x5A (ASCII codes for characters 'A' to 'Z') using the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
Converting from sign-magnitude to two's complement using the operators ! ~ & ^ | + << >>
